# Documentation
Within this folder is the documentation for the technologies that were used and how the system works as a whole.

The entire backend API is documented with [OpenAPI 3.0.2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) in this [file](/api/openapi.yaml).
It is also generated into an easily readable website [here](https://akrantz01.github.io/apcsp).
